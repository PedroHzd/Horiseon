# The Horiseon Website is now Live

## Changes 

I updated both HTML and CSS files to better organize the code. 
There was a broken link and no comments in the files. 
The CSS file is needed to be rearranged and simplify. 

## Usage

Here is the [link](https://pedrohzd.github.io/Horiseon/) to the website.
